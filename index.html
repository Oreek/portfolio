                </div>
                <p>I am just an average student studying in an average Indian school. I like programming quite a lot, unlike CAD (which I personally do not dislike but don't find very interesting) and love to build silly stuff. Currently I am studying in grade 11 just so you know ig.</p>

                        <summary>Is your whole body completely white by birth? Is it an illness? Can it be cured?</summary>
                        <p>No, I have a condition called <strong>Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA)</strong> which causes loss of pigment in my skin throughout my body, making everything from my hair to my eyes appear very white. It is not an illness or disease but rather just a loss of 'melanin' causing me issues in sunlight, and hence has no cure for it. You should avoid asking this question to me IRL because answering the same has become way too annoying now.</p>

                        <summary>Since when did you start programming?</summary>
                        <p>You could say I started around 2020 when COVID hit hard. I had too much free time so I started programming discord bots. Kind of a fact but my first ever project was an discord economy bot made using discordjs v12</p>
